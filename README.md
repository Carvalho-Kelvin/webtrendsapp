# Habit Tracker App

A simple web application for tracking daily habits. Users can add, edit, complete, and delete habits, and view progress over time. The app integrates with Firebase for data persistence and uses Google authentication for sign-in. It also supports a biometric (face recognition) option for future enhancements.

## Features

- **Add Habits:** Create new habits with a name, daily goal, and unit (e.g., pages, kilometers).
- **Edit Habits:** Update the habit name, daily goal, and unit.
- **Complete Habits:** Mark habits as completed and view them in a separate section.
- **Authentication:** Sign in using Google and (optionally) biometric authentication.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Offline Support:** Progressive Web App (PWA) features enabled via service worker.
